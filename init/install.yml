# The directory where the master files will be located.
master_dir: install/default

# A list of master basenames which reside in master_dir.  These will be copied
# to the corresponding array key of installed files, after first replacing
# __ROLE with the role being processed.  That is to say that there will be no
# actual file called _.htaccess.__ROLE_ but rather three files: _.htaccess.dev_,
# _.htaccess.staging_,  _.htaccess.prod_ located in the master_dir.
master_files:
  - .htaccess.__ROLE
  - install.local.__ROLE.yml
  - perms.local.__ROLE.yml
  - settings.env.__ROLE.php
  - settings.local.__ROLE.php

# The locations where the master files will be copied to.
installed_files:
  - web/.htaccess
  - bin/config/install.local.yml
  - bin/config/perms.local.yml
  - web/sites/default/settings.env.php
  - web/sites/default/settings.local.php

# You can setup commands or scripts to be run.  Each key is an array of commands
# or filenames of scripts to be executed.  Each line executes in a subshell and
# must return 0 or the installation will fail. The following keys are available:
# - pre_install
# - pre_install_{ROLE}
# - post_install
# - post_install_{ROLE}
scripts:
#  pre_install_dev:
#    - mkdir -p web/modules/dev
#    - rm web/modules/dev/se_dev || return 0
#    - cd web/modules/dev/ && ln -s ../../../install/default/modules/se_dev .
#  post_install:
#    - install/scripts/after.sh
#  post_install_prod:
#    - git pull
#    - ./bin/perms apply
